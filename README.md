# Arbitrage - a node.js script to help find and act on arbitrage opportunities. 
A cryptocurrency arbitrage opportunity calculator and trading bot. Over 800 currencies and 50 markets.

To use, install nodejs and run `npm install` in the folder where the script `main.js` is. To run the program write `node main` or `npm start`. To change market settings, and to add your own markets edit the `settings.js` file.

## Roadmap

#### V1.00 (Current) * 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. A live website displaying the data will be available soon. 

### Prerequisites

Required: Node.js ** ^ V8.0.0** this program uses ES7 features such as async/await and requires a new version of node.

### Installing

CD into the correct folder. In a terminal write the following:

Install the required npm modules

```
npm install
```

To run the program

```
npm start
```

In the terminal you will see an array of values ordered lowest to highest.  (Frontend coming soon)

## Adding and removing markets

Currently you will have to add an object in the main.js. I am updating the project every day and this will change soon.  (Will be able to change from frontend soon)
